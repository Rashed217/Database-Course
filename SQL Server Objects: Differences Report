SQL Server Objects: Differences Report


1. Trigger vs. Stored Procedure

- **Trigger**: 
  - Automatically executed in response to specific events on a table (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
  - Cannot be called explicitly; runs when the triggering event occurs.
  - Used primarily for data integrity and enforcing business rules.

- **Stored Procedure**: 
  - A set of SQL statements that can be executed on demand.
  - Can accept parameters and return values.
  - Used for encapsulating repetitive tasks and complex operations.


2. Stored Procedure vs. Function

- **Stored Procedure**: 
  - Can perform actions like modifying database state (INSERT, UPDATE).
  - Does not return a value directly but can return multiple result sets.
  - Invoked with the `EXECUTE` or `CALL` statement.

- **Function**: 
  - Must return a single value (scalar function) or a table (table-valued function).
  - Cannot perform operations that change database state (e.g., DML operations).
  - Can be used in SELECT statements.

3. DROP vs. DELETE Statement

- **DROP**: 
  - Removes an entire database object (table, view, procedure).
  - Cannot be rolled back if not part of a transaction.
  - All data and structure are lost.

- **DELETE**: 
  - Removes rows from a table based on a condition.
  - Can be rolled back if part of a transaction.
  - Retains the structure of the table.




4. SELECT vs. SELECT INTO Statement

- **SELECT**: 
  - Retrieves data from one or more tables.
  - Can be used to return results to the client or another statement.

- **SELECT INTO**: 
  - Creates a new table and populates it with the result set of the query.
  - The new table inherits the structure of the selected columns.



5. DDL, DML, DCL, and DQL

- **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: 
  - Commands like `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP` that define or modify database structures.
  
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: 
  - Commands like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` that manipulate data within existing structures.

- **DCL (Data Control Language)**: 
  - Commands like `GRANT`, `REVOKE` that control access to data.

- **DQL (Data Query Language)**: 
  - Primarily consists of the `SELECT` statement to query data.



6. Table-Valued Function vs. Multi-Statement Function

- **Table-Valued Function**: 
  - Returns a table as a result.
  - Can be used in a FROM clause of a query.

- **Multi-Statement Function**: 
  - Allows multiple SQL statements to be executed and can return a table.
  - Typically used for complex logic and manipulation before returning the result.






 7. VARCHAR(50) vs. VARCHAR(MAX)

- **VARCHAR(50)**: 
  - Fixed maximum length of 50 characters.
  - More efficient in terms of storage for short strings.

- **VARCHAR(MAX)**: 
  - Can store up to 2^31-1 bytes of data.
  - Used for longer text strings but may incur performance overhead.


8. SQL Authentication vs. Windows Authentication

- **SQL Authentication**: 
  - Users provide a username and password stored in SQL Server.
  - Can be used for users outside of Windows domains.

- **Windows Authentication**: 
  - Uses Windows user accounts for authentication.
  - More secure and integrates with Active Directory.


9. Inline Function vs. View

- **Inline Function**: 
  - A function that returns a single table result and can take parameters.
  - Can be used in SQL statements as if it were a table.

- **View**: 
  - A virtual table based on the result of a SELECT query.
  - Does not take parameters and cannot perform operations.


10. Identity vs. Unique Constraint

- **Identity**: 
  - Automatically generates unique values for a column, typically used for primary keys.
  - Ensures sequential values for new records.

- **Unique Constraint**: 
  - Ensures that all values in a column are different, allowing for non-sequential unique values.
  - Can be applied to one or more columns.
